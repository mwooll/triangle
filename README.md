# triangle
a small implementation of a triangle class in SageMath

This project arose as certificate of achievement for "Introduction to computer algebra and mathematical programming", a course I took at the University of Zurich given by Dr. Johannes Andreas Schmitt. As noted in the files I worked together with Alexandra Popova, a fellow student of mine.

As I had quite a lot of time to work on this project, I wanted to incorporate some best practices for software development.
In particular, I focused on test driven development and writing good documentation.
